Godot is a powerful open-source game engine that we use to make our games. It is easily downloadable, and does not require intensive set up or installation. At HoodyHerd, we primarily make 2D games.

With our project-based learning approach, teens are encouraged to get messy, and engage in the whole process of learning. At the end, they’ll come out with a completed project they can speak to, and be proud of. As they make stuff, not only are they practicing in-demand skills, they’re also building up a portfolio of projects they can speak to as they move into more professional spaces.

In many programs, the focus is on memorizing coding principles. HoodyHerd prioritizes learning by creating solutions to business problems using tech as the medium.  We create projects, get stuck, unstuck, and complete said projects.
