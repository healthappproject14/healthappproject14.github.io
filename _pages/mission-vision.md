> HOODYHERD serves as a hub where teens gather to learn, build, grow, and support their communities.

<center>
We provide an online space for teens to make games, mobile apps, and other things with code, while simultaneously cultivating skills that will help them be successful in an ever-expanding, technological world.

With our project-based learning approach, teens are encouraged to get messy, and engage in the whole process of learning. At the end, theyâ€™ll come out with a completed projects they can speak to in personal and professional settings.

In many programs, the focus is on memorizing coding principles. HoodyHerd prioritizes learning by making - not just learning to learn. We create projects, get stuck, unstuck, and complete said projects.

Following participation and as the program grows, students will be invited to join a discord community with other members. In this community, opportunities & resources to continue to build and strengthen portfolios will be provided. The vision is a community of teen developers, working together, making software for small/local businesses in their communities (paid & unpaid).
